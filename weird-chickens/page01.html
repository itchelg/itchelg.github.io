            <h2>Fun facts</h2>
            <p>Underneath all that fluff, the Silkie has black skin and bones. Sadly, this makes them a food delicacy in parts of the Far East.</p>

            <h2>Looks</h2>
            <p>The head should be crested, looking somewhat like a ‘pom-pom’ (similar to a polish chicken). If a comb is present, it should look like a ‘walnut,’ being almost circular in appearance.The comb coloring should be black or dark mulberry – any other color, and it is not a pure Silkie chicken.Their beak is short, quite broad at the base, and it should be grey/blue in color. Eyes are black.Their bodies should be broad and stout, the back is short, and the breast is full.</p>
