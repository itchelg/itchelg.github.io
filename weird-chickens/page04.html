            <h2>Fun facts</h2>
            <p>The first Sultan chickens came to America in 1867. A woman in New York sent them to author and poultry expert Geroge O. Brown, who wrote that the chickens were the tamest and most contented birds he ever owned. He noted that they were fonder of grains and insects than vegetables, and that they “almost constantly” sang that contented chicken song.</p>

            <h2>Looks</h2>
            <p>a V-shaped comb, crest, beard, muffs, large nostrils, white or pale flesh colored beak, reddish-bay eyes, wings carried low, vulture hocks, feathered shanks and toes, and five toes on each foot. The wings are held drooped in a way that obscures the thighs and upper hocks. Sultans are pure white in color and have slate blue shanks and toes.</p>
