            <h2>Fun facts</h2>
            <p>The Houdan or Poule de Houdan is an old French breed of domestic chicken. It is named for its area of origin, the commune of Houdan, in the département of Yvelines to the west of Paris. It belongs to the crested chicken group, is muffed and bearded, has an unusual leaf-shaped comb, and has five toes on each foot rather than the usual four.</p>

            <h2>Looks</h2>
            <p>Mottled white on a black background, Houdan chickens have both beards and crests and make a distinctive impression. They are medium-sized with a long, compact, and well-proportioned body. They have v-shaped combs in America, but historically, their combs were described as “leaf-shaped” – appearing like a butterfly with its wings open. They have large nostrils, white earlobes, reddish-bay eyes, five toes on each foot, and pinkish-white shanks and feet.</p>

            <h2>Personality</h2>
            <p>They are a sweet, docile, friendly breed, although roosters may or may not be aggressive with people. Houdans are best kept with breeds with similar temperaments as they may be “picked on” because of their feathering. They are a good breed for children and they like to be cuddled</p>
