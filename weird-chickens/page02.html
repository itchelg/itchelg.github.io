            <h2>Fun facts</h2>
            <p>Naked neck chickens lay a reasonable 120-150 eggs per year, which works out to be almost one fried, scrambled or poached egg every two to three days for breakfast, alongside some bacon, cereal or whatever else you like to eat while you wake up.</p>

            <h2>Looks</h2>
            <p>Naked Neck roosters carry a single comb, and the neck and head often become very bright red from increased sun exposure. This breed has approximately half the feathers of other chickens, making it resistant to hot weather and easier to pluck.</p>

            <h2>Personality</h2>
            <p>They are very good foragers and are immune to most diseases. The breed is also reasonably cold hardy despite its lack of feathers.</p>
